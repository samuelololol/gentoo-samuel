-    Drop touch events from the driver
-    
-    This was a bad idea. No-one seems to use this and it gives us little benefits.
-    To even get this feature a number of other features need to be turned off
-    (like two-finger scrolling and tapping). Many of these are enabled by default,
-    if they are disabled a client stack with full touchpad gesture support could
-    in theory support true touchpad gestures. This has never happened.
-    
-    Drop the touch events from the synaptics driver. This allows us to switch the
-    touchpad fully over to look like a relative device, thus also removing the
-    bug that changes the touchpad speed whenever a monitor is added/removed in.

-    Revert "Support the new Lenovo X1 Carbon 3rd trackpoint buttons"
-    
-    This reverts commit 064445364b4775b25ba49c2250b22b169f291147.
-    
-    The Lenovo *50 series, including the X1 Carbon 3rd always require multiple
-    kernel patches to enable the touchpad buttons. This patch in synaptics only
-    addresses the re-routing of the top buttons.
-    
-    The final iteration of the kernel patches also route the trackpoint buttons
-    through the trackpoint device, rendering this patch unnecessary. These patches
-    are queued for 4.0.

-    Support the new Lenovo X1 Carbon 3rd trackpoint buttons
-    
-    This device has the trackpoint buttons wired up to the touchpad to send BTN_0,
-    BTN_1 and BTN_2 for left, right, middle. This conflicts with previous
-    touchpads that used those event codes for dedicated scroll buttons.
-    
-    Add an option HasTrackpointButtons that can be set via a xorg.conf.d
-    snippets. This option is not intended as a user-set option, rather
-    we expect distributions to ship some conglomerate of udev/hal rules with
-    xorg.conf snippets that take effect.
-    
-    If the option is set, we look at the three affected buttons at the beginning
-    of HandleState and send button events immediately for them. The HW state is
-    reset to neutral and other processing continues. This saves us from having to
-    synchronize these buttons with software buttons (also present on this device),
-    tapping, etc.
-    
-    Since the buttons are physically different and (mentally) associated with the
-    trackpoint device we also don't need to worry about having finger motion event
-    correctly synced up with the button presses - it's acceptable to send the
-    presses before the motion events.

-    Limit the movement to 20 mm per event
-    
-    Touchpads are limited by a fixed sampling rate (usually 80Hz). Some finger
-    changes may happen too fast for this sampling rate, resulting in two distinct
-    event sequences:
-    * finger 1 up and finger 2 down in the same EV_SYN frame. Synaptics sees one
-      finger down before and after and the changed coordinates
-    * finger 1 up and finger 2 down _between_ two EV_SYN frames. Synaptics sees one
-      touchpoint move from f1 position to f2 position.
-    
-    That move causes a large cursor jump. The former could be solved (with
-    difficulty) by adding fake EV_SYN handling after releasing touchpoints but
-    that won't fix the latter case.
-    
-    So as a solution for now limit the finger movement to 20mm per event.
-    Tests on a T440 and an x220 showed that this is just above what a reasonable
-    finger movement would trigger. If a movement is greater than that limit, reset
-    it to 0/0.
-    
-    On devices without resolution, use 0.25 of the touchpad's diagonal instead.

-    eventcomm: ensure we're on the same clock as the server
-    
-    Default on evdev devices is CLOCK_REALTIME. If that clock falls behind the
-    server's CLOCK_MONOTONIC, motion after a clickpad click may be delayed by the
-    difference in the clocks.
-    
-    In detail:
-    When the timer func is triggered, GetTimeInMillis() which is CLOCK_MONOTONIC,
-    is stored as hwState->millis. The eventcomm backend uses struct
-    input_event time (CLOCK_REALTIME).
-    
-    When we read events from the device, if the evdev time is less than the server
-    time, the fix for (#48777) sets the current event time to hwState->millis.
-    Until the evdev time overtakes that stored time, all events have the
-    hwState->millis time.
-    
-    If during that time a clickpad triggers a physical click,
-    clickpad_click_millis is set to hwState->millis + the ignore-motion timeout.
-    Thus, all motion is ignored until the event time overtakes that stored
-    time.
-    
-    The whole issue is further enhanced by us unconditionally setting the timer
-    func if we get any events, which is a separate issue anyway.

-    Prevent two-finger taps from being ignored

-    When two fingers are used, the coordinates of only one of them is taken into

-    conf: increase top software button area to 15%
-    
-    We had reports that the top software button area is hard to hit for those
-    using the trackpoint and clicking the buttons with their thumb.
-    
-    Analysis of event recordings (3 different people) for left, right and middle
-    clicks shows that there is a significant amount of events up to about 10mm
-    (with outliers up to 12mm) from the top of the touchpad. That maps to 15%.
-    
-    Interestingly, the middle button does not seem to need this, presumably the
-    haptic feedback of the little dots sticking out from the surface make hitting
-    the button easier. Its size is increased to 15% anyway, for simplicity and
-    because a sample set of 3 is too small to be definitive about this.

-    Always count tripletap + click as 3 fingerclick on pads with < 3 touches
-    
-    When trying to do a 3 fingerclick on a touchpad which only tracks 2 touches,
-    this may register as a 3 or 2 fingerclick depending on the order in which
-    the touchpad detects the fingers. If the 2 outer fingers of the 3 get seen
-    first, then the 2 touches will be too far apart for the heuristic to see
-    them as being close together, and the click gets counted as a 2 finger click.
-    
-    A user will likely never do a 2 finger click with a 3th finger resting
-    somewhere else on the pad, where-as the above misdetection of the clicks is
-    a real issue, so simply always count a click with trippletap set as a
-    3 finger click on pads which track less then 3 touches.

-    eventcomm: Hook up the libevdev log handler

-    This is a bit problematic: libevdev only has one global log handler.

-    or get overwritten, whichever comes first. So we need to re-set the handler
-    every time we get an event to make sure we log through our handler.
-    Likewise, if we ever drop the device, we need to unset the log handler back to
-    NULL because we may unload the module and our handler may disappear.
-    
-    Use the lowest logging priority, let the server filter based on the verbosity

-    If the touchpad is in TOUCHPAD_OFF mode, allow physical clicks
-    
-    Enabling clicks in off mode also allows for the new Lenovo *40 series to use
-    the top software buttons while the touchpad is disabled. This benefits those
-    that usually disable touchpads altogether but still need the buttons for the
-    trackstick.
-    
-    This changes existing behaviour, but TouchpadOff was always intended to stop
-    erroneous events while typing. Physical button presses are hard to trigger
-    accidentally. On the touchpads that TouchpadOff concept was originally
-    designed for the buttons are nowhere near the keyboard and are physically
-    separated from the touchpad anyway. On Clickpads, triggering a physical
-    click requires more force than accidentally touching the surface.

-    Add property support for secondary (top) software buttons
-    
-    This was originally intended as a fixed xorg.conf option only (and still
-    largely is seen as such). Secondary software button are required only on a specific series
-    of touchpads and should be pre-configured by the system and/or the
-    distribution. As such, the property will not be initialized if it is not set
-    in the xorg.conf and will thus not respond to runtime changes.
-    
-    Exposing the property in this way gives clients a chance of detecting if a top
-    software button area is present and thus adjust their behaviour accordingly.

-    Notice the BTN_LEFT event all by itself!
-    
-    If this happens, it may lead to the following problem scenario:
-    -touch the touchpad in its right click area
-    -let go of the touchpad
-    -rapidly click in the middle area, so that BTN_LEFT gets reported before the
-     new coordinates (such as seen in the trace above, this may require some
-     practicing with evemu-record to reproduce)
-    -the driver registers the click as a right click because it uses the
-     old coordinates from the cumulative coordinates to determine the
-     click location
-    
-    This commit fixes this by:
-    1) Resetting the cumulative coordinates not only when no button is pressed,
-       but also when there is no finger touching the touchpad, so that when
-       we do get a touch the cumulative coordinates start at the right place
-    2) Delaying processing the BTN_LEFT down transition if there is no finger
-       touching the touchpad
-    
-    This approach has one downside, if we wrongly identify a touchpad as
-    a clickpad, then the left button won't work unless the user touches the
-    touchpad while clicking the left button.
-    
-    If we want we can fix this by doing something like this:
-    1) Making update_hw_button_state return a delay; and
-    2) Tracking that we've delayed BTN_LEFT down transition processing; and
-    3) When we've delayed BTN_LEFT down transition return a small delay value; and
-    4) If when we're called again we still don't have a finger down, just
-       treat the click as a BTN_LEFT
-    
-    But this is not worth the trouble IMHO, the proper thing to do in this
-    scenario is to fix the mis-identification of the touchpad as a clickpad.

-    Don't report motion inside soft-button areas

-    Unless the motion has started outside the soft-button area.
-    
-    Note that we must start reporting motions regardless of whether we think we're
-    in the button area or not as soon as we've switched to using cumulative
-    coordinates, since then the coordinates are no longer absolute.
-    
-    This fixes the reporting of unintended motion just before a click in a soft
-    button area which sometimes causes mis-clicks.

-    Add another third state to TouchpadOff for disabling all but button clicks
-    
-    On a new set of laptops like the Lenovo T440 the trackstick does not have
-    physical buttons. Instead, the touchpad's top edge is supposed to acts
-    software button area. To avoid spurious cursor jumps when the trackstick is in
-    use and the finger is resting on the touchpad, add another mode that disables
-    motion events.
-    
-    Enabled by syndaemon with -t click-only, the default stays unchanged. No
-    specific integration with the traditional disable-while-typing is needed. On
-    such touchpads, disabling motion events is sufficient to avoid spurious
-    events and we don't want to stop HW buttons to send events.
-    
-    Note that this only adds the new state to the driver and to syndaemon, there
-    is nothing hooked up otherwise to actually monitor the trackstick.
-    
-    Special note for syndaemon: optional arguments are a GNU extension, so work
-    around it by messing with an optstring starting with ":" which allows us to
-    manually parse the options.

-    Add secondary (top) software buttons area
-    
-    New generation of laptops with trackstick do not have physical buttons
-    associated with the trackstick, but instead rely on software buttons at
-    the top of the clickpad.
-    Adding a secondary software button area for this purpose.
-    As we're likely detecting the devices that need it based on udev tags
-    and MatchTag configuration items, this area doesn't need to be exposed
-    through properties. So static configuration is fine.

-    Allow using the entire touchpad for motions started inside the active area
-    
-    synaptics offers an option to make parts of the touchpad insensitive. This
-    is ie useful to do palm avoidance rather then palm detection (which may be
-    unreliable) by disabling an area of 15% on the right and left side of the
-    touchpad.
-    
-    Currently a motion which has started inside the active area, stops as soon
-    as it moves outside of the active area.
-    
-    If a motion started inside the active area and thus has already generated some
-    move events, this makes no sense. If the user moves outside of the active
-    area in this case, this is very likely because the user wants to continue
-    the motion.
-    
-    This commit allows such motions to continue normally.
-    
-    I would like to thank Juerd Waalboer for the basic idea, some coding and lots
-    of testing for this fix.

-    Switch to libevdev for the eventcomm backend
-    
-    This has a potential bug that would need to be fixed in mtdev first:
-    if we get a SYN_DROPPED and we miss out on events, the current code emulates a
-    normal EV_SYN, feeds that to mtdev and hopes that that fills the mtdev output
-    queue.
-    
-    If mtdev doesn't generate events on that EV_SYN, we're stuck in limbo and may
-    get weird results. The loop will continue and sync the device, but there's the
-    off chance we get odd events.

-    
-    Apple Magic Trackpad can report 16 slots. In clickpad_guess_clickfingers()
-    the array allocated on the stack contains only 10 slots.
-    As (.num_mt_mask == .num_slots), the function writes out of the bounds

-    Allow soft button areas to overlap on the edge
-    
-    For percent-based configuration in the form of
-    middle button 33%-66%, right button 66%-0 we'd get an error because of the
-    one device unit overlap. This was neither documented nor useful, because
-    leaving a 1% gap leaves an actual gap between the buttons. Allow for an
-    overlap of one device unit on the edge of the buttons.
-    
-    What's picked in that case depends on the implementation of
-    is_inside_softbutton_area but since one device unit is so small, it doesn't
-    matter.

-    conf: add example for AreaBottomEdge on clickpad buttons
-    
-    Those that use clickpad buttons as buttons can see cursor jumps as the press

-    
-    Simple fix is to define the clickpad soft button areas as dead areas, but

-    tapping.

-    Reset num_active_touches on DeviceOff (#52496)
-    
-    When disabling the device, reset num_active_touches to zero. Otherwise,
-    num_active_touches stays at the value it was on DeviceOff(). Future touches
-    add to that value until the index may go past priv->open_slots[].
-    That causes spurious memory corruption on touch ends.
-    
-    And as of 55fc42e7c9b4948cadd4f98ef7b6a3b12e268e3e we ignore pre-existing
-    touches anyway.
-    
-    Test-case:
-    - place num_touches fingers on the touchpad
-    - xinput disable <device>
-    - lift fingers
-    - xinput enable <device>
-    - place finger on device, num_active_touches is now (num_touches + 1)

-    Reset hw->x/y to INT_MIN and skip HandleState until we have x/y events
-    
-    The driver assumes x/y is always valid but after coming from a resume we may
-    get a few events with either ABS_X or ABS_Y (not both). Thus we process with
-    hw->x == 0 and hw->y == somevalue, causing cursor jumps when calculating
-    deltas whenver the real hw->x comes in.
-    
-    Fix this by resetting hw->x/y to INT_MIN and skip state processing until
-    both axes are available.
-    
-    For clickpads, this means handling of data will be delayed until we get
-    at least one motion on each axis. Button presses won't be recognised either
-    until that happens. It requires some skill to not trigger motion on both
-    axes, even more to press a button without doing so.
-    
-    For non-clickpads, handling of motion events will be delayed likewise. If a
-    physical button is pressed immediately after resume we have to assume deltas
-    of x/y.
-    - If the next event is a new touch, it will have ABS_X/ABS_Y set anyway
-    - If the finger was already down, a button event is generated, and the
-      finger has generated ABS_X or ABS_Y only before the event, the next event
-      containing the missing data will cause a jump. The fix for this is more
-      invasive and this is quite a corner-case.

-    Ignore pre-existing touches
-    
-    If a touch is physically active when the device is enabled, then all
-    events for that touch must be ignored. In particular, we cannot close

-    
-    Note that a device is disabled and enabled every time the user types on
-    the keyboard if synclient is used to disable the trackpad while typing.
-    This is a very common option.

-    Fix coasting speed trigger
-    
-    CoastingSpeed is defined as scrolls/s. The previous code just used

-    
-    Divide the estimated delta by the scroll distance to get the accurate
-    scrolls/s number. Since that now changes the contents of what's in
-    coast_speed_y, change the users of that too.

-    Fix coasting for negative scroll directions
-    
-    1874094f0e99d8db319f6cf769ce5a25c9bc490c introduced negative scroll
-    directions. Coasting assumed always-positive increments and triggered an

-    Fix coasting friction
-    
-    As a result of commit 5a1612d4496b51682c9043aa064025c545249de6, coasting speed
-    was bumped up to a different scale by removing the divisor during the
-    calculation of initial coasting speed. This caused coasting friction to have
-    little to no effect, resulting in coasting that lasted virtually forever using
-    the default coasting friction value of 50.
-    
-    This patch multiplies the scroll_dist_{horiz,vert} which was previously used as
-    a divisor for initial coasting speed to the coasting friction before deducting
-    it at each step, thus bringing coasting friction back under control.

-    Stop coasting when two-finger scroll begins
-    
-    There is currently a problem that can lead the coasting to continue while scrolling in a particular situation :
-    with
-     Option "VertTwoFingerScroll" "on"
-     Option "CornerCoasting" "0"
-     Option "CoastingSpeed" "10"
-     Option "CoastingFriction" "50"
-     Option "CornerCoasting" "0"
-    If you scroll down with two finger then raise a finger, coasting will start. But if you put down that finger and try to
-    scroll up, the inertia will still scroll down while you scroll up. This can look like a very particular situation, but
-    happens to me often while scrolling in a big document.
-    
-    This (awfully simple) patch stop coasting when detecting two-finger scroll.

-    Use maximum number of touches reported by evdev

-    This resolves a regression from da461b91659d0c64aa6827e065aee2682116a57e
-    where three touch tap and click actions on certain devices no longer

-    Some devices report a higher touch count than the number of touches they

-    able to report the correct number of touches for these devices when

-    Since this commit, scroll distance was set with SetScrollValuator function

-    Include open but unchanged touches when guessing clickfingers
-    
-    On a clickpad, when the button is pressed the clickfinger guessing will
-    only work properly if all touches have new data to report. If a touch
-    has not changed, then it will not be counted. This leads to inaccurate
-    finger counts.
-    
-    This change ensures that all active touches are counted. Note that the X
-    and Y valuators of active but unchanged touches are still valid.

-
-    Fix clickfinger actions when middle button emulation is enabled
-    
-    When MBE is enabled, a physical left button press is delayed until a
-    timeout is reached. This results in the logical left button being
-    depressed while the physical left button is pressed. The physical state
-    is stored as the "old" hw state, and it is used for detecting a
-    transition from depressed to pressed for clickfinger actions. Since the
-    "old" hw state shows the left button pressed, but the current logical
-    state shows the left button unpressed, when the MBE timeout fires and we
-    set the logical left button pressed the transition check fails.
-    
-    Since the "old" hw state is only used for clickfinger left button press
-    transitions, redefining it to hold the previous logical hw state is
-    sufficient for fixing the bug and should not cause any regressions.

-    Ignore motion during touch count changes on semi-mt devices
-    
-    Semi-mt devices do not track touches. The locations of touches are
-    unknown, we only have the bounding box of two of them. When the number of
-    fingers changes, the bounding box coordinates may change as well, but
-    the cumulative relative motion updates at that instant are invalid.

-    To work around this, ignore changes in cumulative relative motion if the

-    Calculate touch data for semi-mt devices, but don't send touch events

-    Previously, all touch data from semi-mt devices was ignored because the

-    
-    Instead of ignoring semi-mt device touch events, mark the device as

-    Disable scrolling when beginning a clickpad press
-    
-    There really isn't a point to scrolling while a clickpad is pressed. In
-    particular, the clickpad button areas and the horizontal edge scrolling
-    areas overlap, so horizontal edge scrolling must be disabled. Also,
-    performing two finger scrolling while a third finger presses the button
-    would require us to inhibit touch events until four touches are present.
-    That is enough reason to disable two finger scrolling as well.

-    Fix scoll increment for non-smooth scrolling (#46617)
-    
-    Introduced in 2603ad69b997c999404ecc441e0d64ea2cc22018. Previously, the
-    delta was incremented by (actual delta/scroll dist), button clicks where
-    then sent while (delta-- >= 1).
-    
-    After 2603ad69b997c999404ecc441e0d64ea2cc22018, the delta was incremented by
-    the delta only, scroll dist was used as increment in the smooth scrolling
-    information. On non-smooth-scrolling servers, the driver would now send
-    too many events. Restore the old behaviour by dividing by the scroll
-    distance before entering the button click loop.

-    Update touch state when device is off too
-    
-    If the device is turned off, usually by syndaemon to disable the
-    touchpad while the typing, the touch state will not be updated with the
-    latest hardware state changes. If a touch begins while the device is
-    off and ends while the device is on, then the touch count will be
-    decremented without any previous increment. A similar effect will occur
-    if the device is on when the touch begins, but off when the touch ends.
-    
-    If the touch count goes negative, the index into the touch slot mask
-    array will be out of bounds. This can corrupt memory and cause random
-    crashes.

-    Revert "Don't store fake events in the motion history"
-    
-    This commit introduced a regression. On some touchpads, the pointer keeps
-    moving in the last direction when the finger movement stops but the finger
-    is left on the touchpad.
-    
-    Cause appears to be get_delta() which calculates the deltas based on the
-    motion history but has no control flow for the lack of fake motion events
-    in the history after this commit. Thus, under some conditions, the delta is
-    always non-zero as the history does not change.

-    Prefer multitouch over single-touch axis ranges
-    
-    We still use single-touch data in most cases, but sometimes the
-    multitouch axes have higher resolution. Since we use the same XI
-    valuators to report ST and MT data, we must pick one axis and scale the
-    other to match. This change picks the MT axis ranges.

-    The algorithm is completely wrong because it uses subtraction of
-    unsigned variables. The negative effects of this commit manifest in
-    cursor warps to edges or corners of the screen.
-    
-    Since the algorithm has never worked right, previous testing must be

-    
-    This commit reverts 13543b156d78bc4d01a19844a5ee8f283269621b
-    
-    As seen in Debian's #648488, this switch causes a regression on
-    PowerPC, especially seen on iBook G4 with appletouch. Take a defensive
-    stance and revert back to a working state until things have been figured
-    out and fixed properly.
-    
-    Since things have evolved and since that revert triggers a lot of
-    conflicts, the following method was applied:
-     - manual reintroduction of the 3 removed macros: OFF, LONG, TEST_BIT
-     - coccinelle semantic patch to revert from BitIsOn to TEST_BIT
-    
-    Coccinelle semantic patch:
-      @@
-      expression a,b;
-      @@
-      -BitIsOn(a,b)

-    Revert "build: sort building of tools, ensure that cross-pkg-config works."
-    
-    This reverts commit 4005df66072ceac175ea71427deb16176262f197.
-    
-    The patch introduces a couple of issues.
-    1) These tools are apps and conceptually do not depend on Xserver,
-    so XORG_CFLAGS should not be used. It included pixman header files.
-    Only drivers depend xserver
-    
-    2) XORG_CFLAGS may contain, depending on the platform, a compiler
-    visibilty flag. Compiler flags cannot be assigned to AM_CPPFLAGS
-    preprocessor flags variable.
-    
-    There were two changes introduced by the patch.
-    1) Possible wrong order of include directives
-    The commit text does not mention which paths may be in the wrong order.
-    
-    2) Incorrect usage of AM_LDFLAGS
-    The patch does not really change anything. If the intention was for the tools
-    to link directly to the libraries, it would look like:
-    
-      LDADD =  $(top_builddir)/src/libpciaccess.la # scanpci example
-    
-    This is only possible for libraries built in the same package.
-    There is nothing wrong in putting -l -L flags in LDADD, but should there
-    be other flags, LDFLAGS would be required, ending with two variables.
-    
-    It looks easier to revert the patch to the previosuly known good version
-    which has been in service for a year.
-    
-    Unfortunatly, the reversal breaks distcheck as it removes an unsuspected workaround.
-    The value of sdkdir during distcheck points to an empty xserver sdkdir
-    where xserver-properties.h is expected by the tools.
-    
-    Specifying XORG_CFLAGS worked around the issue by supplying the real path
-    to the xserver sdk.

-    Revert "build: collapse all Makefile.am files into a single non-recursive one."
-    
-    This reverts commit 39afe69ad7d2258d4043044d1283bd6e311e48da.
-    
-    1. For such a small module, the build time improvement is most likely
-    negligible. At least, I'd like to see some timings proving it's
-    worthiness before seeing the patch go back in.
-    
-    2. This kind of change would need a thorough review. The need to
-    operate the build from a single toplevel Makefile is a significant
-    change. The two most noticeable issues for me are that collapsing all
-    the Makefiles could easily cause namespacing issues with the
-    variables, and operating on files outside the current directory can
-    introduce subtle bugs. I feel that the non-recursive style is
-    generally less robust than the standard recursive make scheme.
-    
-    3. It's unlike all the other X.org modules. This isn't a showstopper
-    for me, but the recursive style is well understood here and you've
-    beaten all the modules into a consistent format that makes build bugs
-    unique to specific modules less likely.
-

-    
-    To give a concrete example for #3 above, the 175 man pages are much
-    easier maintained using a very similar makefile in the man directory
-    of all X.Org module.
-    
-    The cost of maintaining a single makefile is much higher. Every target
-    in the makefile has to be reviewed and tested when changes are made.
-    Not everyone has the all the skills to handle widely different targets
-    such as man pages, DocBook/XML, librairies, C code, distribution hooks,
-    and so on.

-    
-    This reverts commit d27b4e560ccf61b94f067156c6d5c1e3d3e5e1eb.
-    
-    ChangeLog is generated from git and should be created at dist time only.
-    The original patch creates it at make time multiple times and fails
-    when user permissions change such as when using sudo.
-    
-    Some have expressed a desire to install files such as ChangeLog and README.
-    This reversal does not dismiss the idea, but simply reverts a non-essential
-    change that happens to have an implementation bug just before making a module
-    release.
-    
-    Anyone is welcome to promote the idea in the context of the X.Org project
-    where all modules would exhibit the same behaviour. The current behaviour of
-    ChangeLog, although not perfect, has been thoroughly reviewed and widely
-    accepted for several years.
-    
-    As for the files in docs, they should be re-submitted for reviews to determine
-    if they constitute users docs that should be installed as opposed to
-    developers docs which are not.

-    
-    Althought this feature is desirable, it introduces a dormant bug.
-    
-    The value of sdkdir during distcheck points to an empty xserver sdkdir
-    where xserver-properties.h is expected by the tools.
-    
-    Specifying XORG_CFLAGS for the tools worked around the issue by supplying

-    In any case it would be a brittle workaround.
-    
-    --with-xorg-conf-dir='$${sysconfdir}/xorg':
-    althought this value will work, it brings some confusion as it is
-    unrelated to the where the configuration files are normally placed,
-    relative to $prefix which is /usr/share/X11 and not /etc.

-    This feature can be reintroduced later with the proper solution.

-    Drain XRecord connection of any events after handling replies
-    
-    If the X server sends an event to the XRecord connection the event
-    will never be handled. This will cause the event queue to fill up in
-    Xlib and lead to syndaemon running away at 100% cpu usage.
-    
-    This change drains any events from the connection. It's not a fix for
-    the underlying bug in the server or Xlib, but it does paper over the
-    issue for now.

-    Revert "Default to 2-finger emulation when HW supports it"
-    
-    This changes the default behavior for trackpads that have only pressure
-    information to emulate two finger actions. It's been reported that the
-    default value is too low and/or that the pressure values may fluctuate
-    with environmental factors (temperature, humidity, etc.). When the

-    Don't autoprobe for devices when Option Device is set.
-    
-    If only Option Device is set but no protocol, the code calls into
-    AutoDevProbe. eventcomm (the only backend with an AutoDevProbe) then runs
-    through all /dev/input/event devices and takes the first one it can find.
-    
-    If two touchpads are connected on a system, this may cause the same touchpad
-    to be added twice and the other one not at all - even though the device path
-    is specified. (This can only happen when the event device is not grabbed,
-    otherwise the grabcheck prevents the touchpad from being added twice)
-    
-    Pass the device option into AutoDevProbe and check that device first. If it
-    is a touchpad, finish with success. If it isn't, fail AutoDevProbe.

-    eventcomm: move need_grab into a proto-specific struct.

-    
-    The current code assumes that if a proto_data field is present, we respect

-    Add hysteresis-based noise reduction
-    
-    This introduces hysteresis into the driver's processing. It significantly
-    reduces noise motion, i.e. now the pad does no longer generate a stream of
-    sub-pixel events when just holding the position with the finger down.
-    Also, taking off the finger no longer generates additional motion,
-    scrolling becomes flicker-free etc.
-    
-    The code makes use of "fuzz" from the kernel, if available. This has not
-    been tested extensively, as an overwhelming majority of evdev touchpad
-    drivers view 0 (zero) as a good value for fuzz, forcing userland into
-    assuming "zero fuzz" means "make zero assumptions about fuzz", not
-    "there is no fuzz". Until things improve, this is what we do.
-    
-    Anyway, the fuzz a.k.a. hysteresis can be set/overridden with options
-    and properties, as documented.

-    synaptics: detect corner tap using the initial touch position
-    
-    Currently, when detecting a tap release, the corner tap detection
-    uses the current touch position to figure out which corner it
-    corresponds. The problem is that, theoretically, there is no such position
-    because there is no touch. It work in mosts cases because most touchpad
-    are fast enough to still have a position on release, but some aren't.
-    
-    In that case, the driver do corner tap detection using the position
-    given by the hardware when there is no touch, that is, (0,0), (1,5855)
-    or whatever. The driver will detect them as corner tap, regardless of
-    the initial touch position. On the default configuration, corner taps
-    are ignored, so basically, these tap are not working.
-    
-    This patch make tap detection use the initial touch position to
-    detect corner taps.

-    syndaemon: decouple background mode from quietness
-    
-    syndaemon currently outputs lots of stuff when not running in background mode.
-    However, current init daemons and session managers can manage to launch the
-    daemon in background without "-b" just fine (if not better), by doing the
-    fork() themselves. Indeed, if one uses that setup, ie. by having syndaemon
-    launched by GNOME at login, it gets the ~/.xsession-errors file spammed by
-    Enable/Disabled messages.
-    
-    This patch fixes this by introducing a new verbose (-v) flag that enables those
-    messages and makes syndaemon quiet by default.

-    config: don't autoprobe when device was set
-    
-    If device was already set, we were asked to handle that specific device
-    and we should not go probing around. If we do, we might end up handling
-    a device different from what the X server thinks we are handling, with
-    dire consequences in case of hot plugging and unplugging.
-    
-    Without this patch, a situation such as the following can happen.
-    
-    A user has both a built-in laptop touchpad and a tablet such as the
-    Wacom Bamboo Pen & Touch, that is also exposed as a touchpad.
-    
-    The tablet is plugged in before the server starts, and during setup the
-    server calls the synaptic driver for the /dev/input/mouseX device
-    corresponding to the touch device of the tablet; we end up in the
-    autoprobe path even though `device' was set, and the driver scans
-    /dev/input, where the first useful device it finds is the event device
-    for the built-in touchpad.
-    
-    The driver starts managing the built-in touchpad, preventing future
-    instances from managing it too, while the server thinks the driver is
-    managing the tablet.
-    
-    When the user disconnects the tablet, the corresponding instance of the
-    synpatics driver (which is actually managing the touchpad instead) is
-    unloaded: the built-in touchpad stops working in X.

-    Default to 2-finger emulation when HW supports it
-    
-    Ideally, emulating 2-fingers should just work on hardware
-    were it can be supported. This patch is to do that.
-    
-    Currently, emulateTwoFingerMinW defaults to 7. Most kernel
-    drivers do not support reporting finger width and so can't get above
-    MinW of 7. Synaptics devices hardcode width value to 5 when
-    hardware doesn't support width and 7 is a good threshold to detect
-    2 fingers on hardware that does. bcm7954 are only other devices
-    that report width and they support reporting DOUBLETAP and wouldn't
-    need emulation anyways.
-    
-    emulateTwoFingerMinZ defaulted to a really high value so never
-    let Synaptics devices to emulate 2-fingers by default.
-    Changed default to a low value (same as FingerHigh) when hardware
-    doesn't support DOUBLETAP and supports width so emulations
-    will now work by default in all the right cases.
-    
-    I'm working to get kernel to stop reporting ABS_TOOL_WIDTH unless
-    hardware really supports it.  If that would have been behavior
-    in first place then we could also default to 2-finger scrolling as
-    well.  Since its not reliable, we should continue defaulting to
-    side scrolling.
-    
-    Config GUI's will want to now allow switching between 2-finger and edge
-    scrolling when new property indicates width is supported.  GUI's should
-    also update the above MinZ and MinW's to values similar to our defaults.

-    Some input devices will not return any ranges and

-    Purge GuestMouse support.
-    
-    Guest mouse dates back to quite a while ago, hasn't been tested for ages and
-    the current synaptics interface guide claims the bit that we used to check
-    if guestmouse is available is "reserved for future use. The host should
-    ignore the values of reserved bits when reading the capability bits."

-    Reshuffle to handle dead area better.
-    
-    This patch makes input in the dead area essentially disappear to the client.
-    If a finger is detected outside the active area, it's coordinates and other
-    data is reset to zero. Edge detection and scrolling is skipped and the event
-    is not recorded in the movement history.
-    
-    On touchpads that require this area, it is now possible to click the button
-    while leaving another finger on the touchpad.
-    
-    Regression: moving into the dead area during a drag releases the drag button.

-    Disable ClickFinger for touchpads with more than one physical button (#26079)
-    
-    If a touchpad has more than just one (or no) button, don't enable any
-    ClickFinger settings other than button 1.
-    
-    The old default of enabling those clickfingers can be confusing on devices
-    that have left and right buttons but no middle. In that case, leaving three
-    fingers on the touchpad and clicking will result in a button 2 press
-    (usually paste). But leaving one or two fingers on the touchpad while
-    clicking will simply send button 1 events.
-    
-    This can appear like spurious button 2 events to the user.

-    Remove the "SpecialScrollAreaRight" option.  (#21001)
-    
-    This option auto-adjusts the right edge on the touchpad but wrongly so. It
-    does not take the edge width into account, thus setting the right edge to
-    the max value received - leaving only a single-pixel scroll area in some
-    cases.
-    
-    A previous attempt to auto-adjust edges has failed (afb60a0b). The kernel's
-    min/max values cannot be relied on for actual range clipping and thus scroll
-    edge settings are best left untouched.

-    Revert "Auto-adjust edges if values fall outside queried min/max ranges. (#21001)"
-    
-    This reverts commit afb60a0b2497c5d08cbd1739fa8ae6585c428881.
-    
-    From comment 24 to #21001:
-    I've been running this code for over a week now and I'm not happy with it.
-    Once I move over to the right, the scroll-edge becomes so small that it's
-    hard to trigger.
-    
-    Source of the problem is the information provided by the kernel. The kernel
-    hands us a min/max value for the synaptics pads but this value is not
-    reflective of the actual physical boundaries. The other dimensions are based
-    on these min/max ranges.
-    
-    My RightEdge setting by default is 5129, after moving to the right it
-    becomes 5677. The announced max for x is 5472.  We have model-specific edge
-    settings and in the case of synaptics the width of the scroll area is 7% of
-    the total width (based on min/max). This works, but obviously only because
-    the max is wrong. I've tried upping this to 15% and it works fine but unless
-    the edge is adjusted the scroll bar takes over too much of the pad.
-    
-    So right now I'm inclined to revert this patch and just ditch any
-    auto-adjustment of scroll edges whatsoever. This way, the original setting
-    is maintained even if we reach outside of the min/max area.

-    Add active area outside of which movements, scrolling, tapping are ignored.
-    
-    On some touchpads physical buttons are located under the touchpad surface. As a
-    result, when users try to perform a click, by pressing that part of the surface
-    of the touchpad, they get a click, a movement, a tap and (in some cases) a scroll,
-    which can make clicks quite inaccurate.
-    
-    The "Synaptics Area" property can be used to define the edges of the active area of
-    the touchpad so that all movement, scrolling and tapping which take place outside
-    of this area will be ignored. This property is disabled by default.

-    Add configurable x/y resolution to fix sensitivity on wide touchpads.
-    
-    Synaptics uses anisotropic coordinate system.  On some wide touchpads
-    vertical resolution can be twice as high as horizontal which causes
-    unequal sensitivity on x/y directions.
-    
-    VertResolution and HorizResolution can be used to set the resolution.
-    The ratio of the values is used to compensate x/y sensitivity.  The
-    properties are configured automatically if touchpad reports resolution
-    and if running on linux 2.6.31 or newer.

-    Auto-adjust edges if values fall outside queried min/max ranges. (#21001)
-    
-    The kernel provides min/max for x/y values but still allows devices to send
-    coordinates outside this range. If the edges are autodetected, re-adjust the
-    edge settings to fit within the new effective min/max range.
-    
-    When the edges change the property needs to be updated accordingly. This
-    can't be done immediately as changing properties requires mallocs and
-    HandleState is called during the signal handler.
-    Instead, set a timer to be called when the server isn't busy and update the
-    property then. The delay between setting the timer and sending the property
-    notify event also reduces the number of events sent, the property event
-    includes the latest state only.
-    
-    If the edges were configured by the user, don't re-adjust.
-    This obsoletes the SpecialScrollAreaRight option as it provides the same
-    functionality, without the side-effects triggering 21001.

-    synclient: up max value for AccelFactor to 1.0
-    
-    There's no real reason to restrict AccelFactor to 0.2, the driver itself
-    doesn't restrict AccelFactor either. Upwards of 1.0 it's hard to spot any
-    real differences in speed though, so 1.0 seems like a sensible maximum.

-    eventcomm: force boolean values for has_left, has_right, etc.
-    
-    TEST_BIT simply returns the value of the bytes, so we end up with has_left
-    and friends being an integer value instead of a boolean value. This again

-
-    Add TapAndDragGesture option and gestures property.
-    
-    The tap-and-drag gesture is an alternative way of dragging.
-    It is performed by tapping (touching and releasing the finger), then
-    touching again and moving the finger on the touchpad.
-    This gesture is enabled by default and can be disabled by setting the
-    TapAndDragGesture option to false.
-    
-    The gesture already existed in synaptics and was always enabled. This
-    commit adds an option to switch it on/off. The default behavior is
-    tap-and-drag being enabled, that is, TapAndDragGesture is true.
-    
-    The "Synaptics Gestures" property is intended to hold all new gesture
-    enabling options, like options for the upcoming multitouch gestures.

-    I created a table to iterate through the different products rather than

-    Add TouchpadModel specifier and scale the edges accordingly. (#21214)
-    
-    ALPS models need different edge settings than synaptics pads to make the edges
-    work propertly. So try to auto-detect the model (eventcomm anyway) and set the

-    
-    New edge defaults are:
-     synaptics: 7% of the total width
-     alps: 15% of the total width
-     unknown: 4% of the total width (see Synaptics UI guide)

-    PS/2 interface: sense multifinger taps on FingerHigh (#21427)
-    
-    Previously multifinger taps were sensed on the Z value > 0: this isn't
-    very correct.  Accorging to the specification, Z values below 30
-    correspond only to a very light taps or just floating fingers.  I had
-    run into the situation when I was clicking on the physical left button
-    and that click was transformed to the right button click via
-    ClickFinger2, but I wasn't tapping the touchpad at all.  Investigations
-    showed very small values of Z -- my other fingers were just floating
-    above touchpad.
-    
-    This change also makes click (and finger) detection more consistent,
-    because it uses FingerHigh to detect taps everywhere.

-    syndaemon: if we wanted XRECORD, but it failed, exit.
-    
-    If Xrecord is missing but we requested it (say, didn't disable it explicitly),
-    then exit. Don't use the alternative SHM area, it's bad for your health.

-    Ignore moves during tap processing if no finger is down.
-    
-    The Dell Inspiron 1520 with a Synaptics touchpad loves to send event like
-    these after every finger release :
-    
-        time     x    y   z f  w  l r u d m     multi  gl gm gr gdx gdy

-    
-    Most of the time these events are ignored by the driver, but sometimes it
-    confuses two-finger scrolling and tap detection.
-    
-    For example, in this log, the first tap is recognized, the second isn't :
-    
-        time     x    y   z f  w  l r u d m     multi  gl gm gr gdx gdy

-    The problem with the second tap is that the driver check if the movement from
-    (3848,2361) to (1,5855) is over TapMaxMove before it checks for a finger release.
-    So the driver considers it as a (short) finger move.
-    Add the condition ''the finger is still present'' to the 'move' condition, so
-    we ignore these moves..

-    Remove repeater functionality.
-    
-    Remove the repeater functionality completely from the synaptics touchpad
-    driver. It is buggy in its current implementation and its usefulness is
-    questionable.
-    
-    According to the INSTALL file, the repeater is there only for testing. In
-    fact, if a supported device is found even a configured repeater fifo is
-    automatically disabled. For most users the functionality is therefore
-    irrelevant and can be confusing. If I understand the workings of the
-    repeater correctly, a developer could instead just read the data directly
-    from an unsupported device's character special file under /dev
-    or /dev/input.
-    
-    With today's more dynamic device configuration possibilities via udev and
-    hal it's also less likely that the synaptics driver would silently block
-    another devices data, this situation being for what the repeater
-    functionality seems to have been introduced in the past.

-    Improve edge autodetection and accel.
-    
-    The synaptics spec specifies "typical axis ranges" for synaptics devices.
-    Based on these typical ranges, calculate edge coordinates and apply the same
-    proportions to the device at hand.
-    Based on the hard-coded ranges and acceleration, calculate accel for
-    autodetected ranges in the same proportions.

-
-    Pre-probe the device (eventcomm only).
-    
-    For auto-dev, we'd probe the device node and get the axis ranges. If we
-    specify the device however we didn't retrieve the axis ranges and thus got
-    stuck with the defaults - losing out on automatic edge and accel calculation.
-    
-    This is an issue if the device is hotplugged, as HAL will specify the device
-    node.
-    
-    This patch adds another hook to synproto_operations to pre-probe the device.
-    This hook is only used by eventcomm and opens the FD, queries the axis range
-    and closes the FD again.

-    Don't lose button up event if timeout is cancelled in the same ReadInput cycle
-    
-    On a left/right button press, middle button emulation springs into action and
-    changes the reported hw state. It then returns a delay that is supposed to set
-    a timer. No button event is posted to the server, the timer ensures that it'll
-    be posted later.
-    
-    If however - in the same cycle - the button up is reported, but with a
-    hardware time > middle emulation timeout, the middle button emulation is
-    canceled. The hw state is reset to button down, and processing continues,
-    reporting the button down event.
-    Since this is in the same cycle, the new delay overrides the previous one and
-    the timer is never set.
-    
-    Introduce a new state into MB emulation that forces the click event if the
-    above situation occurs.

-    Disentangle two-finger tap and two-finger scrolling
-    
-    When two-finger-scrolling quickly and distinctly, the two-finger tapping gets activated, effectively selecting a portion of the selected text. The synaptics code already has logic to prevent taps from
-    being registered when the fingers move; this patch simply removes what appears to be an unnecessary assumption that only single-finger clicks needs this functionality.

-    Initial version that passes "make distcheck".
-    
-    This version is able to build against latest xorg git (including xinput
-    changes for MPX). It incoperates many concepts stolen from xf86-input-evdev.
-    I'm not sure about *BSD support, but from what I understood psmcomm is only
-    used on *BSD whild eventcomm is only used on Linux. So I enabled the build
-    of these only on the given operating system. Also fix some minor issues that
-    are related to the old build system (VERSION_ID related).

-    Instead of locking indefinitely, dragging is realeased after a

-    
-    To observe the behavior: move with 1 finger. During movement add a 2nd

-    seamlessly to scroll mode. Worked on the Macbook touchpad, but failed
-    on some Dell touchpad.

-
-    On Linux 2.6, the evdev interface provides support for requesting the
-    resolution of input devices. The included patch uses this to set the
-    defaults for various parameters. As a result, synaptics, alps and
-    appletouch pads all work approximately identically without requiring
-    model-specific configuration. The defaults should be almost identical to
-    the current defaults on synaptics pads. We've shipped this code in the
-    current Ubuntu release (7.04) without any known user issues. This is
-    against current git.

-
-    Implement 2-finger emulation for ALPS touchpads.
-    
-    A new parameter, EmulateTwoFingerMinZ, makes the driver emulate
-    2-finger scrolling (and tapping) when the finger pressure is big
-    enough. This is no real multi-finger detection (the ALPS hardware
-    can't do that), but seems to work quite well in practice.
-    
-    From Ingmar Ellenberger.

-    Don't include $(DESTDIR) in $(INSTALLED_X).
-    
-    Mattia Dongili writes:
-    
-    In your new release I found a little bug in the Makefile in one use of
-    $(DESTDIR), when assigning the $(INSTALLED_X) variable.
-    
-    Since its usage is mainly to find _real_ includes, while DESTDIR is
-    mainly used when creating binary packages to define a different root
-    directory, I doubt you'll find any usable include there.

-    Add new parameter "SingleTapTimeout".
-    
-    This patch adds a new parameter - "SingleTapTimeout" - to control the
-    "2A -> SINGLETAP" transition.
-    
-    This gives greater control of tap behavior. For exmple, it is possible
-    to disable tap-and-drag by setting the parameter to 0.

-    Vertical/horizontal scrolling was incorrectly stopped then
-    the finger left the lower right corner if the scrolling was started
-    from within that corner. The problem was that in that case both
-    horizontal and vertical scrolling was enabled at the same time until
-    the finger left the corner. When the finger left the corner, one of the
-    scrolling directions was supposed to stop, but buggy handling of
-    coasting made both scrolling directions stop.

-    Make the device name change code handle more cases. Patch
-    from Karl Tomlinson <k.tomlinson@auckland.ac.nz>, who writes:
-    
-    There are two issues that are resolved here:
-    
-    1 The call to xf86ReplaceStrOption in DeviceOn, when the device
-      file can no longer be opened seems unnecessary and causes
-      problems.  If Protocol is auto-dev then Device is reset anyway
-      (through SetDeviceAndProtocol).  If Protocol is something else
-      then the device file will never be found even after it is
-      recreated because Device is never set again.
-    
-    2 The first xf86OpenSerial in DeviceOn may successfully open a
-      different mouse (or other event file) that has the same name as
-      the Device found through the first invocation of auto-dev.  It
-      seems reasonable that if auto-dev is used to find the device
-      file the first time, then it can be used to find it again after
-      the device has been closed (and possibly changed name).

-    The touchpad stopped working if you did:
-    1. From inside X ran "rmmod psmouse"
-    2. Switched to the console
-    3. Switched back to X
-    4. Ran "modprobe psmouse"
-    5. Switched to the console.
-    6. Switched back to X.
-    After this sequence, the device name was set to an event device but the
-    protocol was psaux. The problem was that when the auto-redetection
-    failed in step 3, the protocol was set to psaux but the device name was
-    not cleared. In step 6, opening the old event device succeeded again,
-    so SetDeviceAndProtocol() was not called, and the protocol remained set
-    to psaux.

-
-    Better noise reduction in the x/y delta estimates used for
-    pointer motion. The derivative estimate is now based on linear
-    regression from the last four x/y values instead of the last three.
-    This means that white noise is amplified by a factor of sqrt(.2)
-    instead of sqrt(.5), ie the factor of improvement is 1.58. Similar
-    improvements have been observed in data from a real synaptics
-    touchpad.
-    Also, the computations are performed in floating point math to avoid
-    round off errors for very slow finger movements.

-
-    Improved edge motion behavior. The speed no longer depends
-    on the MinSpeed, MaxSpeed and AccelFactor parameters, and it doesn't
-    depend on the packet rate from the touchpad hardware.
-    The EdgeMotionMinSpeed and EdgeMotionMaxSpeed parameters may have to be
-    modified to get the same speed as before this change.

-
-    Better fix for the crash fixed in change
-    cbee47a1f26038ade7386fa52b41d1828036dd1e. The shared
-    memory area is now removed at DEVICE_CLOSE time but recreated if
-    necessary at DEVICE_INIT time. This fixes the problem where the shared
-    memory area was not deleted when exiting the X server, thereby fooling
-    the synclient program to think the driver was still active.

-    instead of relying on the IDs of the input device.

-
-    Fixed some problems with ALPS guest devices.
-    From Alastair M. Robinson:
-    
-    * The guest mouse doesn't report button releases.
-    
-    * The stick pointer has buttons of its own, and they don't work.
-    
-      Attached is another patch, this one far less invasive than the last,
-      which fixes these two problems.
-      (The button presses that come from the stick pointer's buttons arrive
-      in events with pressure set to 127, just like stick movement - but
-      this doesn't seem to be terribly reliable - I think the button
-      release gets reported with true pressure when the touchpad is being
-      used too.  For this reason, I've set these up to report as ->left /
-      ->right, not as ->guest_left / ->guest_right.)
-    
-    * One issue that remains - the middle button emulation for two button
-      mice doesn't seem to work for the guest mouse.
-      Fixed by me.

-
-    Patch from Alastair M. Robinson
-    <blackfive@fakenhamweb.co.uk> to make the ALPS dual trackpad found on
-    Dell CPx machines work. (For 2.4 kernels.)
-    
-    In order to get my trackpad working in absolute mode I had to make some
-    modifications to the driver:
-    
-    Firstly, initialising the trackpad on this model is more complicated
-    than other ALPS devices; the usual "magic knock" must be performed for
-    both the trackpad and the pointing device, and I found that I needed a
-    device reset first to get reliable initialisation.
-    
-    Secondly, the pointing stick, for obvious reasons, provides relative
-    data even when the trackpad is in absolute mode.
-    
-    Thirdly, the guest mouse in the PS/2 port continues to send 3-byte
-    packets.

-    Don't remove the shared memory segment when DEVICE_CLOSE is
-    received. When exiting a KDE session in FC2, DEVICE_CLOSE is sent to
-    the synaptics driver, but the X server doesn't quit. Therefore, the
-    driver will use a stale memory area afterwards, which can cause X
-    server crashes and prevent synclient from working.

-Date:   Thu Sep 25 01:37:13 2003 +0200
-
-    Added support for the new 2.6 kernel events ABS_TOOL_WIDTH,
-    BTN_TOOL_FINGER, BTN_TOOL_DOUBLETAP and BTN_TOOL_TRIPLETAP. Note that
-    this swaps the direction of the Y axis internally to match X and the
-    linux input subsystem. Because of this, the TopEdge and BottomEdge
-    parameters must be modified in the config file. There is some backwards
-    compatibility code for old 2.5/2.6 kernels that will probably be
-    deleted later.

-
-    Longer timeout in the reset sequence. Experience from the
-    2.5 kernel driver has shown that 4 seconds is needed for some
-    touchpads.

-Date:   Tue Jul 8 00:38:28 2003 +0200
-
-    Fixed race condition caused by asynchronous IO (SIGIO). This
-    change hopefully fixes the X server hangs.

-
-    Use packet counting instead of time to decide when to start
-    generating pointer movement events. This fixes the bug that incorrectly
-    moved the cursor to the upper right corner when quickly putting the
-    finger on the touchpad.

-Author: Peter Osterlund <petero2@telia.com>
-Date:   Thu Jun 19 01:19:38 2003 +0200
-
-    Rewrote timer handling so that the driver no longer depends
-    on packets arriving 1s after the last state change. (The kernel driver
-    only reports to user space when something changes.) Use wall clock time
-    instead of packet counting for time computations. This change also
-    means that configurable times are now specified in milliseconds instead
-    of units of 1/80s.

-    * Clicks shorter than EmulateMidButtonTime are no longer lost.

-Basic Installation
-==================
-
-   Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
-configure, build, and install this package.  The following
-more-detailed instructions are generic; see the `README' file for
-instructions specific to this package.  Some packages provide this
-`INSTALL' file but do not implement all of the features documented
-below.  The lack of an optional feature in a given package is not
-necessarily a bug.  More recommendations for GNU packages can be found
-in *note Makefile Conventions: (standards)Makefile Conventions.
-
-   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
-various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
-those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
-It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
-definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
-you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a
-file `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for
-debugging `configure').
-
-   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'
-and enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves
-the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  Caching is
-disabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale
-cache files.
-
-   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
-to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
-diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
-be considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at
-some point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you
-may remove or edit it.
-
-   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create
-`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You need `configure.ac' if
-you want to change it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version
-of `autoconf'.
-
-   The simplest way to compile this package is:
-
-  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
-     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.
-
-     Running `configure' might take a while.  While running, it prints
-     some messages telling which features it is checking for.
-
-  2. Type `make' to compile the package.
-
-  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
-     the package, generally using the just-built uninstalled binaries.
-
-  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
-     documentation.  When installing into a prefix owned by root, it is
-     recommended that the package be configured and built as a regular
-     user, and only the `make install' phase executed with root
-     privileges.
-
-  5. Optionally, type `make installcheck' to repeat any self-tests, but
-     this time using the binaries in their final installed location.
-     This target does not install anything.  Running this target as a
-     regular user, particularly if the prior `make install' required
-     root privileges, verifies that the installation completed
-     correctly.
-
-  6. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
-     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
-     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
-     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
-     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
-     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
-     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
-     with the distribution.
-
-  7. Often, you can also type `make uninstall' to remove the installed
-     files again.  In practice, not all packages have tested that
-     uninstallation works correctly, even though it is required by the
-     GNU Coding Standards.
-
-  8. Some packages, particularly those that use Automake, provide `make
-     distcheck', which can by used by developers to test that all other
-     targets like `make install' and `make uninstall' work correctly.
-     This target is generally not run by end users.
-
-Compilers and Options
-=====================
-
-   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
-the `configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help'
-for details on some of the pertinent environment variables.
-
-   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
-by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
-is an example:
-
-     ./configure CC=c99 CFLAGS=-g LIBS=-lposix
-
-   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.
-
-Compiling For Multiple Architectures
-====================================
-
-   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
-same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
-own directory.  To do this, you can use GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
-directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
-the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
-source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.  This
-is known as a "VPATH" build.
-
-   With a non-GNU `make', it is safer to compile the package for one
-architecture at a time in the source code directory.  After you have
-installed the package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before
-reconfiguring for another architecture.
-
-   On MacOS X 10.5 and later systems, you can create libraries and
-executables that work on multiple system types--known as "fat" or
-"universal" binaries--by specifying multiple `-arch' options to the
-compiler but only a single `-arch' option to the preprocessor.  Like
-this:
-
-     ./configure CC="gcc -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" \
-                 CXX="g++ -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64" \
-                 CPP="gcc -E" CXXCPP="g++ -E"
-
-   This is not guaranteed to produce working output in all cases, you
-may have to build one architecture at a time and combine the results
-using the `lipo' tool if you have problems.
-
-Installation Names
-==================
-
-   By default, `make install' installs the package's commands under
-`/usr/local/bin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You
-can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving
-`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX', where PREFIX must be an
-absolute file name.
-
-   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
-architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
-pass the option `--exec-prefix=PREFIX' to `configure', the package uses
-PREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
-Documentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.
-
-   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
-options like `--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular
-kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
-you can set and what kinds of files go in them.  In general, the
-default for these options is expressed in terms of `${prefix}', so that
-specifying just `--prefix' will affect all of the other directory
-specifications that were not explicitly provided.
-
-   The most portable way to affect installation locations is to pass the
-correct locations to `configure'; however, many packages provide one or
-both of the following shortcuts of passing variable assignments to the
-`make install' command line to change installation locations without
-having to reconfigure or recompile.
-
-   The first method involves providing an override variable for each
-affected directory.  For example, `make install
-prefix=/alternate/directory' will choose an alternate location for all
-directory configuration variables that were expressed in terms of
-`${prefix}'.  Any directories that were specified during `configure',
-but not in terms of `${prefix}', must each be overridden at install
-time for the entire installation to be relocated.  The approach of
-makefile variable overrides for each directory variable is required by
-the GNU Coding Standards, and ideally causes no recompilation.
-However, some platforms have known limitations with the semantics of
-shared libraries that end up requiring recompilation when using this
-method, particularly noticeable in packages that use GNU Libtool.
-
-   The second method involves providing the `DESTDIR' variable.  For
-example, `make install DESTDIR=/alternate/directory' will prepend
-`/alternate/directory' before all installation names.  The approach of
-`DESTDIR' overrides is not required by the GNU Coding Standards, and
-does not work on platforms that have drive letters.  On the other hand,
-it does better at avoiding recompilation issues, and works well even
-when some directory options were not specified in terms of `${prefix}'
-at `configure' time.
-
-Optional Features
-=================
-
-   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
-with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
-option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.
-
-   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
-`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
-They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
-is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
-`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
-package recognizes.
-
-   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
-find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
-you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
-`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.
-
-   Some packages offer the ability to configure how verbose the
-execution of `make' will be.  For these packages, running `./configure
---enable-silent-rules' sets the default to minimal output, which can be
-overridden with `make V=1'; while running `./configure
---disable-silent-rules' sets the default to verbose, which can be
-overridden with `make V=0'.
-
-Particular systems
-==================
-
-   On HP-UX, the default C compiler is not ANSI C compatible.  If GNU
-CC is not installed, it is recommended to use the following options in
-order to use an ANSI C compiler:
-
-     ./configure CC="cc -Ae -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500"
-
-and if that doesn't work, install pre-built binaries of GCC for HP-UX.
-
-   HP-UX `make' updates targets which have the same time stamps as
-their prerequisites, which makes it generally unusable when shipped
-generated files such as `configure' are involved.  Use GNU `make'
-instead.
-
-   On OSF/1 a.k.a. Tru64, some versions of the default C compiler cannot
-parse its `<wchar.h>' header file.  The option `-nodtk' can be used as
-a workaround.  If GNU CC is not installed, it is therefore recommended
-to try
-
-     ./configure CC="cc"
-
-and if that doesn't work, try
-
-     ./configure CC="cc -nodtk"
-
-   On Solaris, don't put `/usr/ucb' early in your `PATH'.  This
-directory contains several dysfunctional programs; working variants of
-these programs are available in `/usr/bin'.  So, if you need `/usr/ucb'
-in your `PATH', put it _after_ `/usr/bin'.
-
-   On Haiku, software installed for all users goes in `/boot/common',
-not `/usr/local'.  It is recommended to use the following options:
-
-     ./configure --prefix=/boot/common
-
-Specifying the System Type
-==========================
-
-   There may be some features `configure' cannot figure out
-automatically, but needs to determine by the type of machine the package
-will run on.  Usually, assuming the package is built to be run on the
-_same_ architectures, `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
-a message saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the
-`--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
-type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:
-
-     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM
-
-where SYSTEM can have one of these forms:
-
-     OS
-     KERNEL-OS
-
-   See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
-`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
-need to know the machine type.
-
-   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should
-use the option `--target=TYPE' to select the type of system they will
-produce code for.
-
-   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a
-platform different from the build platform, you should specify the
-"host" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will
-eventually be run) with `--host=TYPE'.
-
-Sharing Defaults
-================
-
-   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
-you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
-default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
-`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
-`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
-`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
-A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.
-
-Defining Variables
-==================
-
-   Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the
-environment passed to `configure'.  However, some packages may run
-configure again during the build, and the customized values of these
-variables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set
-them in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:
-
-     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc
-
-causes the specified `gcc' to be used as the C compiler (unless it is
-overridden in the site shell script).
-
-Unfortunately, this technique does not work for `CONFIG_SHELL' due to
-an Autoconf bug.  Until the bug is fixed you can use this workaround:
-
-     CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash /bin/bash ./configure CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash
-
-`configure' Invocation
-======================
-
-   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
-operates.
-
-`--help'
-`-h'
-     Print a summary of all of the options to `configure', and exit.
-
-`--help=short'
-`--help=recursive'
-     Print a summary of the options unique to this package's
-     `configure', and exit.  The `short' variant lists options used
-     only in the top level, while the `recursive' variant lists options
-     also present in any nested packages.
-
-`--version'
-`-V'
-     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
-     script, and exit.
-
-`--cache-file=FILE'
-     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,
-     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to
-     disable caching.
-
-`--config-cache'
-`-C'
-     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.
-
-`--quiet'
-`--silent'
-`-q'
-     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
-     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
-     messages will still be shown).
-
-`--srcdir=DIR'
-     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
-     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.
-
-`--prefix=DIR'
-     Use DIR as the installation prefix.  *note Installation Names::
-     for more details, including other options available for fine-tuning
-     the installation locations.
-
-`--no-create'
-`-n'
-     Run the configure checks, but stop before creating any output
-     files.
-
-`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
-`configure --help' for more details.

+  3 Finger Dragging does not respect LockedDrags; instead, 3FD will
+  always be locked drag (in the sense that it allows the user's
+  fingers to leave the touchpad for the period of time.) Double Tap
+  Dragging respects LockedDrags just like it originally does.
+
+  Accuracy in detecting the 3-finger tap (seen as middle click) is
+  enhanced by handling another status transition sequence (TS_1 ->
+  TS_3FINGER_START -> TS_SINGLETAP) in addition to the usual
+  transition sequence (TS_1 -> TS_2A -> TS_SINGLETAP).
+
+2015-04-12
+  Now the three-finger dragging respects the LockedDrags option.
+  I think it is very convenient also, because when you do a 3-finger
+  dragging you are very likely to run out of space, which makes a 
+  long-distance drag difficult, e.g. when you want to drag a window
+  across 2 monitors.
+
+  The Locked Drag is activated when you release 1, 2 or 3 fingers
+  in the middle of a 3-finger dragging. A Locked 3-Finger Drag can 
+  only be continued by a 3-Finger Drag, not 1 or 2 fingers.

+\`configure' configures xf86-input-synaptics 1.9.0 to adapt to many kinds of systems.
+
+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']
+
+Installation directories:
+  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
+                          @<:@@S|@ac_default_prefix@:>@
+  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
+                          @<:@PREFIX@:>@
+
+By default, \`make install' will install all the files in
+\`$ac_default_prefix/bin', \`$ac_default_prefix/lib' etc.  You can specify
+an installation prefix other than \`$ac_default_prefix' using \`--prefix',
+for instance \`--prefix=\$HOME'.
+
+For better control, use the options below.
+
+Fine tuning of the installation directories:
+  --bindir=DIR            user executables [EPREFIX/bin]
+  --sbindir=DIR           system admin executables [EPREFIX/sbin]
+  --libexecdir=DIR        program executables [EPREFIX/libexec]

+Usage: $0 [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
+
+To assign environment variables (e.g., CC, CFLAGS...), specify them as
+VAR=VALUE.  See below for descriptions of some of the useful variables.
+
+Defaults for the options are specified in brackets.
+
+Configuration:
+  -h, --help              display this help and exit
+      --help=short        display options specific to this package
+      --help=recursive    display the short help of all the included packages
+  -V, --version           display version information and exit
+  -q, --quiet, --silent   do not print \`checking ...' messages
+      --cache-file=FILE   cache test results in FILE [disabled]
+  -C, --config-cache      alias for \`--cache-file=config.cache'
+  -n, --no-create         do not create output files
+      --srcdir=DIR        find the sources in DIR [configure dir or \`..']

+It is possible to use this driver with an ALPS Glidepoint device. If
+you use an older 2.6 linux kernel which has no ALPS input driver, you
+need to apply the ALPS kernel patch in the alps.patch file. See
+http://www.kernelnewbies.org/faq/ for information about how to apply
+kernel patches and compile kernels.
+
+Note! If you use kernel 2.6.11 or later, the alps patch is already
+included, so you don't have to patch your kernel.
+
+Since ALPS touchpads don't have the same resolution as Synaptics
+touchpads, you probably have to change some parameter values. Here is
+an example InputDevice section for the X configuration file.
+
+Section "InputDevice"
+  Driver	"synaptics"
+  Identifier	"Mouse[1]"
+  Option	"Device"		"/dev/psaux"
+  Option	"Protocol"		"auto-dev"
+# enable SHMConfig if you want to enable synclient
+# NB: enabling SHMConfig is insecure, since any user can invoke it
+#  Option	 "SHMConfig"		 "on"
+  Option	"LeftEdge"		"120"
+  Option	"RightEdge"		"830"
+  Option	"TopEdge"		"120"
+  Option	"BottomEdge"		"650"
+  Option	"FingerLow"		"14"
+  Option	"FingerHigh"		"15"
+  Option	"MaxTapTime"		"180"
+  Option	"MaxTapMove"		"110"
+  Option	"EmulateMidButtonTime"	"75"
+  Option	"VertScrollDelta"	"20"
+  Option	"HorizScrollDelta"	"20"
+  Option	"CornerCoasting"	"1"
+  Option	"CoastingSpeed"		"3"
+  Option	"MinSpeed"		"0.3"
+  Option	"MaxSpeed"		"0.75"
+  Option	"AccelFactor"		"0.015"
+  Option	"EdgeMotionMinSpeed"	"200"
+  Option	"EdgeMotionMaxSpeed"	"200"
+  Option	"UpDownScrolling"	"1"
+  Option	"CircularScrolling"	"1"
+  Option	"CircScrollDelta"	"0.1"
+  Option	"CircScrollTrigger"	"2"
+EndSection
+
+If you use a 2.4 linux kernel, you don't need to patch the kernel, but
+you should instead set "Protocol" like this:
+
+  Option	"Protocol"		"alps"
+
+
+On some (all?) ALPS hardware, it is not possible to disable tapping
+unless you apply the patch below. However, some users have reported
+that this patch breaks tap-and-drag operations, which is why the patch
+is not included in the main alps.patch file.

+Trouble-shooting guide

+2. Check that an external PS/2 mouse isn't causing problems
+3. Check if some other program is using the /dev/psaux device
+4. Check that the evdev kernel driver is available
+5. Check that the synaptics driver is properly loaded by the X server
+6. Check that the touchpad is enabled in the BIOS/hardware
+
+
+1. Check that the touchpad is correctly detected by the kernel
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+
+If you are using a 2.6 linux kernel, check the /proc/bus/input/devices
+file. The touchpad must be identified a "SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad"
+or an "AlpsPS/2 ALPS TouchPad". If it is identified as a "PS/2 Generic
+Mouse" or "PS/2 Synaptics TouchPad", something is wrong.
+
+Possible fixes:
+
+1. Check your BIOS settings. Some BIOSes can do USB -> PS/2 mouse
+   emulation which can interfere with the touchpad. There may be a way
+   to disable the legacy mouse emulation from the BIOS setup program.
+
+2. Arrange so that the kernel initializes the USB subsystem before the
+   PS/2 touchpad. Initializing the USB mouse sometimes disables the
+   BIOS emulation. Compiling psmouse as a module and loading it in
+   /etc/rc.d/rc.local usually assures the USB is initialized first.
+
+3. Disconnect the USB mouse and restart the computer. (Not really a fix,
+   but can help when trying to figure out what's wrong.)
+
+4. Make sure your boot loader doesn't pass any parameter to the kernel
+   that disables mouse extensions. ("psmouse_proto=bare" for example).
+   Alternatively, if psmouse is compiled as a module, make sure that
+   modprobe doesn't pass such parameters. Check /etc/modprobe.conf and
+   "rmmod psmouse; modprobe -v psmouse".
+
+If you run a 2.4 kernel or an non-linux kernel, the
+/proc/bus/input/devices file is not available, but the BIOS setting
+could be relevant anyway.
+
+
+2. Check that an external PS/2 mouse isn't causing problems
+-----------------------------------------------------------
+
+If you want to use an external PS/2 mouse at the same time as the
+synaptics touchpad driver, you must use a 2.6 linux kernel and your
+hardware (keyboard controller) must support active multiplexing. You
+should see something like this when the computer boots:
+
+       mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
+       i8042.c: Detected active multiplexing controller, rev 1.1.
+       serio: i8042 AUX0 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
+       serio: i8042 AUX1 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
+       serio: i8042 AUX2 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
+       serio: i8042 AUX3 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
+
+If you don't use a 2.6 kernel or your hardware doesn't support active
+multiplexing, you can't use an external PS/2 mouse together with the
+touchpad driver.
+
+
+3. Check if some other program is using the /dev/psaux device
+-------------------------------------------------------------
+
+If you use a 2.4 linux kernel, only one program at a time can reliably
+read from /dev/psaux. This means that if you for example have GPM
+running, it will probably prevent the synaptics driver from working
+correctly. It also means that if you have a second InputDevice in your
+X configuration file, it must not read from /dev/psaux. You probably
+want it to read from /dev/input/mice instead, which will handle USB
+mice in both 2.4 and 2.6 linux kernels, and both USB and external PS/2
+mice if you use a 2.6 kernel.
+
+The 2.6 linux kernel fixes the /dev/psaux shortcoming, so that you can
+safely run GPM and the synaptics driver at the same time.
+
+
+4. Check that the evdev kernel driver is available
+--------------------------------------------------
+
+If you are using a 2.6 linux kernel, the evdev kernel driver is needed
+for the X driver to be able to communicate with the kernel driver.
+Check the /proc/bus/input/devices file. The Handlers= line should
+contain an event device name, like this:
+
+	H: Handlers=mouse0 event0
+
+If there is no event handler, you either have to load the evdev kernel
+module or recompile the kernel and build it into the kernel. If you
+don't want to recompile the kernel, adding "/sbin/modprobe evdev" to
+/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit usually works.
+
+
+5. Check that the synaptics driver is properly loaded by the X server
+---------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+The X log file is usually called /var/log/XFree86.0.log or
+/var/log/Xorg.0.log. It should contain something like this:
+
+	(II) LoadModule: "synaptics"
+	(II) Loading /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/input/synaptics_drv.o
+	(II) Module synaptics: vendor="X.Org Foundation"
+	        compiled for 4.3.99.902, module version = 1.0.0
+	        Module class: X.Org XInput Driver
+	        ABI class: X.Org XInput driver, version 0.4
+
+If the LoadModule line is missing, you probably forgot to add
+
+	Load "synaptics"
+
+to the "Module" section in the X config file, or you modified the
+wrong config file. Some systems that have been upgraded from XFree86
+to Xorg or from XFree86 3.x to XFree86 4.x can have multiple config
+files in the /etc/X11/ directory, but only one is used.
+
+Next, check that the log file also contains a line like this:
+
+	(II) Synaptics touchpad driver version 0.13.4
+
+If there is no such line, there is probably a binary compatibility
+problem between the synaptics driver and the X server.
+
+Possible fixes:
+
+1. Try upgrading to the latest synaptics driver.
+
+2. Try installing the X SDK package if it is available for your
+   version of X. (In Fedora Core 2, that package is called
+   xorg-x11-sdk-6.7.0-2.i386.rpm.) Then re-compile the synaptics
+   driver and try again.
+
+3. Make sure the driver is compiled with the same compiler version as
+   the X server.
+
+
+6. Check that the touchpad is enabled in the BIOS/hardware
+----------------------------------------------------------
+
+On some computers, it is possible to disable the touchpad either with
+a special key combination, from the BIOS, or with a special touchpad
+on/off button. On some machines, cycling the power doesn't
+automatically reenable the touchpad.
+
+If the touchpad appears to be dead, try to enable it from the BIOS or
+using a key combination. One user also reported that he had to remove
+the computer battery to make his touchpad operational again.
